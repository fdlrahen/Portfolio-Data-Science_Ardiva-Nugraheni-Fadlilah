# 🌲 Random Forest vs SVM for Structured Prediction

This project explores two classical machine learning algorithms — Random Forest and Support Vector Machines — for structured prediction tasks. It benchmarks their strengths in terms of precision, interpretability, and handling imbalanced data.

## 🔍 Objective
This project aim to predict student Dropout and academic. Identify which algorithm performs better on classification tasks with mixed-type features.

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## 💾 Dataset
- Preprocessed dataset with categorical and numerical features
- Labels for binary or multi-class classification

## ⚙️ Modeling
- Random Forest with grid search optimization
- SVM with kernel tuning (linear, RBF)

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision / Recall
- F1 Score
- ROC-AUC

## 📊 Visualization
- Grouped bar chart for metrics
- Decision boundaries (if 2D)
- Feature importance plot
