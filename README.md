# 🧠 Data Science & Machine Learning Portfolio

Welcome! This repository showcases a diverse collection of my applied machine learning and data science projects, covering NLP, time-series forecasting, classification, and semantic search. Each folder contains its own source code, README, and output visualizations.

## 🔍 Projects

### 🤖 Chatbot LLM with RAG & Hermes Pro 2 Mistral
A retrieval-augmented chatbot combining semantic vector search with generative responses using Mistral-based transformer models.

### 📈 Bitcoin Forecasting: LSTM vs GRU
A deep learning time-series study comparing LSTM and GRU architectures on predicting Bitcoin prices.

### 🌲 Random Forest vs SVM Comparison
An evaluation of classical machine learning algorithms on structured prediction tasks using multiple metrics and visual analysis.

### 🐦 Twitter Crawling & NLP Analysis
A crawling pipeline for Twitter data preprocessing and analysis, primed for downstream NLP use cases like sentiment or topic modeling.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- Python, Jupyter Notebook  
- Scikit-learn, TensorFlow / PyTorch  
- SentenceTransformers, FAISS, LangChain  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- GitHub Desktop for version control  

## 📂 Repo Structure

Each project is organized in its own folder with source code, output visualizations, and a dedicated `README.md` file describing objectives, methods, and key results.
